The following section is a tutorial that explains how to use DBS Guide. Provided are two sections, **Surgery Walk-through** and **Widgets**. We recommend you to start with **Surgery Walk-through** as it will explain how to use DBS Guide at each phase of the surgery (pre/intra/post-operation). **Widgets** is a great reference that explains how to use each widget.
